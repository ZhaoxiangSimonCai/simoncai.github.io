However, a lack of large proteomic datasets across a range of cancer types has limited our understanding of proteome network organisation and regulation. We produced a pan-cancer proteomic map derived from 949 human cancer cell lines. The map encompasses more than 40 cancer types derived from over 28 distinct human tissues. The samples were processed with a clinically-relevant workflow involving rapid and minimally complex sample preparation, quantifying 8,500 proteins. The raw proteomic data were acquired by data independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) at ProCan® in Australia. The processed data were analysed with a bespoke deep learning-based pipeline (DeeProM) that integrates multi-omics, CRISPR-Cas9 gene essentiality and drug sensitivity information produced at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. First, our findings reveal pervasive post-transcriptional modification and thousands of putative protein biomarkers of cancer vulnerabilities. Second, DeeProM statistics show that a fraction of the proteome can confer similar predictive power to the entire transcriptome. This has key implications for the clinical application of proteomics in drug response prediction. Third, we demonstrate that a random proportion of the identified proteins can provide robust predictions of cancer cell phenotypes, underpinning the concept of pervasive co-regulation of protein networks. This pan-cancer cell line proteomic map is a comprehensive resource that expands our understanding of cancer proteomes. These data reveal principles of cancer cell phenotypes, including genetic vulnerabilities and drug sensitivities, that are important for developing novel targeted anticancer therapies.","tags":["Deep Learning","Machine learning","Multi-omics","Pan-cancer","Drug response","CRISPR-Cas9"],"title":"Pan-cancer proteomic map of 949 human cell lines reveals principles of cancer vulnerabilities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhaoxiang Cai","Rebecca C Poulos","Qing Zhong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1637798400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637798400,"objectID":"0dc0fecee44cae8c0658be3adefdd960","permalink":"https://olimon660.github.io/simoncai.github.io/talk/integrating-multi-omics-data-with-biological-knowledge-by-transformer-based-deep-learning./","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/simoncai.github.io/talk/integrating-multi-omics-data-with-biological-knowledge-by-transformer-based-deep-learning./","section":"event","summary":"Omics data analysis, powered by machine learning, has significantly improved cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

For drug responsiveness and therapeutics, it is necessary to identify the clones in tumor sample accurately. Many methods are developed to infer tumor heterogeneity by either computing cellular prevalence and tumor phylogeny or predicting genotype of mutations. All methods suffer some problems e.g. inaccurate computation of clonal frequencies, discarding clone specific genotypes etc. In the paper, we propose a method, called- HetFHMM to infer tumor heterogeneity by predicting clone specific genotypes and cellular prevalence. To infer clone specific genotype, we consider the presence of multiple mutations at any genomic location. We also tested our model on different simulated data. The results shows that HetFHMM outperforms recent methods which infer tumor heterogeneity. Therefore, HetFHMM is a novel approach in tumor heterogeneity research area.","tags":["Machine Learning","Genomics","Cancer"],"title":"HetFHMM: A novel approach to infer tumor heterogeneity using factorial Hidden Markov model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liyun Guan","Junfei Tian","Rong Cao","Miaosi Li","Zhaoxiang (Simon) Cai","Wei Shen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1412899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1412899200,"objectID":"a3d8b62aa452e8791ba4480c7b7e4bbe","permalink":"https://olimon660.github.io/simoncai.github.io/publication/barcode/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/simoncai.github.io/publication/barcode/","section":"publication","summary":"This study introduced a barcode-like design into a paper-based blood typing device by integrating with smartphone-based technology. The concept of presenting a paper-based blood typing assay in a barcode-like pattern significantly enhanced the adaptability of the assay to the smartphone technology. The fabrication of this device involved the use of a printing technique to define hydrophilic bar channels which were, respectively, treated with Anti-A, -B, and -D antibodies. These channels were then used to perform blood typing assays by introducing a blood sample. Blood type can be visually identified from eluting lengths in bar channels. A smartphone-based analytical application was designed to read the bar channels, analogous to scanning a barcode, interpret this information, and then report results to users. The proposed paper-based blood typing device is rapidly read by smartphones and easy for the user to operate. We envisage that the adaptation of paper-based devices to the widely accepted smartphone technology will increase the capability of paper-based diagnostics with rapid assay result interpretation, data storage, and transmission.","tags":["Software Development"],"title":"Barcode-Like Paper Sensor for Smartphone Diagnostics: An Application of Blood Typing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://olimon660.github.io/simoncai.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/simoncai.github.io/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
