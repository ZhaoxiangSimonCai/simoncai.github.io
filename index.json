The figure below shows five simulated eye conditions when they have corresponding disease compared with normal vision.\nEarly detection of common ocular diseases is quite difficult since few symptoms are visible in the early stage of diseases. For example, people with longer standing diabetes have a higher chance of developing Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). The early sign of diabetic eye disease is microaneurysms, which is small and hard to detect. Macula is responsible for the central vision. Macula with fluid buildup will distort vision. Function degeneration of macula in aged people has no symptoms in the early stage. Cataract is also commonly seen in aged people. It will decrease human\u0026rsquo;s vision. Glaucoma refers to a group of diseases that causes damage to the optic nerve head, which is irreversible. Moreover, hypertension will change the morphological structures of blood vessels, for example, diameter changes and tortuosity alteration. It can produce cardiac-cerebral vascular diseases, like strokes and heart attacks. Finally, vision loss is also of high risk in myopia people because of progressive retinal pigment epithelial thinning and attenuation. Early detection of these diseases could prevent vision damage and other problems.\nThe purpose of this challenge is to develop methods for automatic ocular disease classification. With color fundus images from left and right eyes as inputs (may use other provided information, such as patient age, sex), the goal of ocular disease classification is to classify a patient into eight catagories, including normal, diabetes, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, hypertension, myopia and other diseases/abnormalities.\n","date":1571097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571097600,"objectID":"168f103dd6e06e6062dd997f0681f36c","permalink":"https://olimon660.github.io/simoncai.github.io/project/odir2019/","publishdate":"2019-10-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/simoncai.github.io/project/odir2019/","section":"project","summary":"In ophthalmology, fundus screening is an economic and effective way to prevent blindness as early as possible that cased by diabetes, glaucoma, cataract, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and many other causes.","tags":["Deep learning","Computer vision"],"title":"Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (3rd prize winner)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I designed a new method which can be used by embryologists to determine the embryo differentiation propensity, given bulk RNA-seq data or qPCR data.

For drug responsiveness and therapeutics, it is necessary to identify the clones in tumor sample accurately. Many methods are developed to infer tumor heterogeneity by either computing cellular prevalence and tumor phylogeny or predicting genotype of mutations. All methods suffer some problems e.g. inaccurate computation of clonal frequencies, discarding clone specific genotypes etc. In the paper, we propose a method, called- HetFHMM to infer tumor heterogeneity by predicting clone specific genotypes and cellular prevalence. To infer clone specific genotype, we consider the presence of multiple mutations at any genomic location. We also tested our model on different simulated data. The results shows that HetFHMM outperforms recent methods which infer tumor heterogeneity.

These channels were then used to perform blood typing assays by introducing a blood sample. Blood type can be visually identified from eluting lengths in bar channels. A smartphone-based analytical application was designed to read the bar channels, analogous to scanning a barcode, interpret this information, and then report results to users.
