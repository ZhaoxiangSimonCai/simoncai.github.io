However, most machine learning methods consider each gene as an independent feature, failing to integrate experimentally-acquired gene regulation and pathway information. The benefit of utilising this information increases in the era of multi-omics, because gene regulation is the key mechanism that links different omic layers together. Here, we present an interpretable deep learning model, DeepPathNet, which uses cancer-specific pathway information for both single and multi-omics data analysis. DeePathNet leverages the cutting-edge deep learning technique, Transformer, which is derived from the field of natural language processing, to model complex interactions between pathways from omics data. The computation of self-attention in the Transformer module allows DeePathNet to learn the encoding of pathways to achieve superior predictive performance and interpretability. Techniques such as drop out layers are also integrated into DeePathNet to maximise its generalisability for unseen data. Moreover, DeePathNet supports any number of omics layers and can handle missing values. Using multiple evaluation metrics, we demonstrate that DeePathNet robustly outperforms traditional methods for predicting drug response and cancer type on four publicly available datasets, namely COSMIC Cell Lines, Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC), Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP). DeePathNet also provides reliable model interpretation, potentially enabling biomarker discoveries at the pathway level. Using the Transformer, DeePathNet is the first method that supports multi-omics data analysis, integrates cancer pathway knowledge into modelling, and provides pathway-level model explanation.","tags":["Deep Learning","Multi-omics","Transformer"],"title":"Integrating multi-omics data with biological knowledge by Transformer-based deep learning.","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

For drug responsiveness and therapeutics, it is necessary to identify the clones in tumor sample accurately. Many methods are developed to infer tumor heterogeneity by either computing cellular prevalence and tumor phylogeny or predicting genotype of mutations. All methods suffer some problems e.g. inaccurate computation of clonal frequencies, discarding clone specific genotypes etc. In the paper, we propose a method, called- HetFHMM to infer tumor heterogeneity by predicting clone specific genotypes and cellular prevalence. To infer clone specific genotype, we consider the presence of multiple mutations at any genomic location. We also tested our model on different simulated data. The results shows that HetFHMM outperforms recent methods which infer tumor heterogeneity. Therefore, HetFHMM is a novel approach in tumor heterogeneity research area.","tags":["Machine Learning","Genomics"],"title":"HetFHMM: A novel approach to infer tumor heterogeneity using factorial Hidden Markov model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liyun Guan","Junfei Tian","Rong Cao","Miaosi Li","Zhaoxiang (Simon) Cai","Wei Shen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1412899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1412899200,"objectID":"a3d8b62aa452e8791ba4480c7b7e4bbe","permalink":"https://olimon660.github.io/simoncai.github.io/publication/barcode/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/simoncai.github.io/publication/barcode/","section":"publication","summary":"This study introduced a barcode-like design into a paper-based blood typing device by integrating with smartphone-based technology. The concept of presenting a paper-based blood typing assay in a barcode-like pattern significantly enhanced the adaptability of the assay to the smartphone technology. The fabrication of this device involved the use of a printing technique to define hydrophilic bar channels which were, respectively, treated with Anti-A, -B, and -D antibodies. These channels were then used to perform blood typing assays by introducing a blood sample. Blood type can be visually identified from eluting lengths in bar channels. A smartphone-based analytical application was designed to read the bar channels, analogous to scanning a barcode, interpret this information, and then report results to users. The proposed paper-based blood typing device is rapidly read by smartphones and easy for the user to operate. We envisage that the adaptation of paper-based devices to the widely accepted smartphone technology will increase the capability of paper-based diagnostics with rapid assay result interpretation, data storage, and transmission.","tags":["Software Development"],"title":"HetFHMM: A novel approach to infer tumor heterogeneity using factorial Hidden Markov model","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://olimon660.github.io/simoncai.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/simoncai.github.io/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
